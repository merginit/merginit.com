- **Dynamic Apps**: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel (Pro plan), Netlify, Render, or Koyeb for serverless or PaaS solutions; Oracle Cloud for VM-based apps; InfinityFree for PHP-based sites.
- **Prototyping**: Glitch for collaborative coding; Render, Koyeb, InfinityFree, GoogieHost, or ProFreeHost for traditional or serverless hosting.
- **Commercial Use**: Netlify, Cloudflare, Render, Koyeb, Oracle, GoogieHost, ProFreeHost, ByetHost; Vercel requires Pro plan; GitHub Pages has restrictions.
- **Scalability**: Cloudflare, Render, Koyeb, and Oracle offer cost-effective scaling; Vercel and Netlify are pricier per user; InfinityFree has affordable upgrades.
- **Sandbox vs. Business**: Glitch is a public sandbox; Netlify, Cloudflare, Render, Koyeb, and Oracle are business-ready; InfinityFree and others are less reliable for critical use.

For serious commercial projects, consider paid plans for better reliability and support. Always verify current pricing and terms, as they may change.
