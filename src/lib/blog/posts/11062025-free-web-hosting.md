# Free Website and Web Service Hosting Options in 2025

Hosting a website or web service for free is an attractive option for developers, hobbyists, and small businesses. This blog post explores a range of free hosting services, including GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, Netlify, ~~Glitch~~, Render, Koyeb, Sevalla, PythonAnywhere, Oracle Cloud Free Tier, InfinityFree, GoogieHost, ProFreeHost, ByetHost, AWS Free Tier, Firebase Hosting, and HelioHost. Each service is evaluated for its features, pros and cons, runtime support, upgrading costs, scalability, commercial usability, server downtime, and support for static or dynamic content. A summary table provides a quick overview, followed by detailed sections for each service.

> **⚠️ Update June 2025**: Glitch announced they will be shutting down their web hosting service on July 8, 2025. While historically a popular option for prototyping and collaborative development, it is no longer recommended for new projects. See the Glitch section below for migration alternatives.
