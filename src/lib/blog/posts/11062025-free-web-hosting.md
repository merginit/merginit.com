# Free Website and Web Service Hosting Options in 2025

Hosting a website or web service for free is an attractive option for developers, hobbyists, and small businesses. This blog post explores a range of free hosting services, including GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, Netlify, ~~Glitch~~, Render, Koyeb, Sevalla, PythonAnywhere, Oracle Cloud Free Tier, InfinityFree, GoogieHost, ProFreeHost, ByetHost, AWS Free Tier, Firebase Hosting, and HelioHost. Each service is evaluated for its features, pros and cons, runtime support, upgrading costs, scalability, commercial usability, server downtime, and support for static or dynamic content. A summary table provides a quick overview, followed by detailed sections for each service.

> **⚠️ Update June 2025**: Glitch announced they will be shutting down their web hosting service on July 8, 2025. While historically a popular option for prototyping and collaborative development, it is no longer recommended for new projects. See the Glitch section below for migration alternatives.

### Glitch (Service Ending)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Glitch announced in May 2025 that they will be ending web hosting for apps on **July 8, 2025**. User profiles and project hosting will be shut down, though dashboards will remain available through the end of 2025 for code downloads and setting up redirects. This makes Glitch no longer a viable option for new projects or long-term hosting.

**Migration Path**: Glitch has stopped accepting new Pro subscriptions and will provide guides to help users export projects and migrate to other platforms. They recommend exploring alternatives like Fly.io, Deno Deploy, GitHub Pages, Val Town, Netlify, and Digital Ocean.

## Choosing the Right Platform

### By Category

- **Custom Code Platforms**: Best for developers who want full control over their applications. Choose GitHub Pages or Surge for static sites, Cloudflare Workers or Deno Deploy for serverless APIs, Netlify or Vercel for JAMstack apps, and Render or Koyeb for full-stack applications.

- **Website Builder Platforms**: Ideal for non-technical users. Google Sites for simple, free websites or Webflow for more sophisticated designs with CMS capabilities.

- **Traditional Hosting**: Suitable for conventional PHP/MySQL websites. Choose InfinityFree or FreeHostia for reliable free hosting, or Oracle Cloud/AWS for more advanced infrastructure needs.

### By Use Case

- **Static Sites**: GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Sevalla, Firebase Hosting, and **Surge** for unlimited projects with custom domains; Google Sites for simple sites; Webflow for limited static sites with CMS capabilities; Netlify for additional features.
- **Dynamic Apps**: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel (Pro plan), Netlify, Render, Koyeb, Deno Deploy, Val Town for modern serverless; Oracle Cloud, AWS, PythonAnywhere for traditional hosting; InfinityFree, **FreeHostia**, and **LeadHoster** for PHP/MySQL-based hosting.
- **Prototyping**: Render, Koyeb, Deno Deploy, Val Town for modern serverless; InfinityFree, GoogieHost, ProFreeHost, **FreeHostia**, and **LeadHoster** for traditional hosting; Netlify, Vercel, or **Surge** for static site workflows.
- **Commercial Use**: Most Custom Code platforms (Netlify, Cloudflare, Render, Koyeb, Oracle, Deno Deploy, **Surge**) and Traditional hosting (GoogieHost, ProFreeHost, ByetHost, **FreeHostia**, **LeadHoster**); Val Town and Webflow require paid plans for full commercial features; Vercel requires Pro plan; GitHub Pages has restrictions.
- **Scalability**: Custom Code platforms (Cloudflare, Render, Koyeb, Oracle, Deno Deploy, **Surge**) offer better scaling; Traditional hosting provides affordable upgrades but with resource limitations.
- **Sandbox vs. Business**: Custom Code platforms are generally business-ready; Website Builders vary by plan; Traditional hosting is better for non-critical or sandbox use due to resource limitations.

For serious commercial projects, consider paid plans for better reliability and support. Always verify current pricing and terms, as they may change.
