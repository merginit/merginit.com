# Comprehensive Comparison of Major Payment Processors for Online Businesses

Selecting the right payment processor is crucial for online businesses, particularly those dealing with digital products or subscriptions, such as SaaS companies. This comparison dives into ten major payment processors—Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Digital River, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Square, and Authorize.Net—focusing on their pricing, features, compliance capabilities (especially for EU businesses), and whether they act as merchants of record (MoR). The analysis aims to help you choose the best processor for your business needs, with a special emphasis on EU compliance and support for digital products.

## What is a Merchant of Record?

A Merchant of Record (MoR) is the entity legally responsible for processing card transactions, handling tax compliance, fraud protection, and customer support related to payments. When a processor acts as MoR, it simplifies compliance for businesses, especially in regions like the EU with complex VAT regulations. Without an MoR, merchants must manage these responsibilities themselves, often requiring additional tools or services.

## Payment Processor Comparisons

**Pricing**:

**Cost Comparison Example**:
For a business with $10,000 MRR and 100 transactions of $100 each:
- **Polar.sh**: 4% of $10,000 = $400, plus 100 × $0.40 = $40, totaling $440.
- **UseAutumn.com**: Growth plan at $50/month, plus Stripe fees (2.9% of $10,000 = $290, plus 100 × $0.30 = $30), totaling $370. If tax compliance is needed, adding Stripe Tax (0.5% of $10,000 = $50) brings the total to $420.

Polar.sh may have a slightly higher cost but offers the advantage of handling tax compliance, which can save significant time and resources, especially for EU businesses. UseAutumn.com is more cost-effective for businesses comfortable managing compliance separately.

In summary, Polar.sh is ideal for businesses seeking a comprehensive payment solution with tax compliance handled, particularly for digital products and SaaS. UseAutumn.com is best for Stripe users needing streamlined billing management for complex pricing models.

## Choosing the Right Processor

Selecting a payment processor depends on your business's specific needs, transaction volume, and compliance requirements:

- **Startups and Small Businesses**: Stripe (standard), PayPal, and Square remain cost-effective with no monthly fees and robust integrations. For those using Stripe, UseAutumn.com can enhance billing management for complex pricing models.
- **EU Compliance Needs**: Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Digital River, Stripe’s Managed Payments, and Polar.sh are top choices as they act as merchants of record, handling VAT and sales tax compliance critical for EU regulations.
- **Large Enterprises**: Adyen and Digital River offer customizable solutions tailored to high-volume businesses with global operations.
- **Businesses with Physical Presence**: Square's integration of online and POS solutions is perfect for retailers with both channels.
- **Traditional Gateway Needs**: Authorize.Net offers reliability and extensive integrations for businesses with existing merchant accounts.

## Considerations for EU Companies

EU businesses face stringent VAT and tax compliance requirements. Processors acting as MoR—Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Digital River, and Stripe's Managed Payments—simplify these obligations by managing tax calculations and remittances across multiple jurisdictions. This is particularly advantageous for SaaS and digital product companies operating in the EU, as it reduces the need for in-house tax expertise.

## Conclusion

The best payment processor depends on your business model and needs. For EU businesses or those selling digital products, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Digital River, Stripe’s Managed Payments, and Polar.sh stand out thanks to their merchant-of-record services and integrated tax-compliance support. Polar.sh’s open-source, developer-friendly approach (4% + $0.40 per transaction) is particularly attractive for engineering-led teams.

For startups already using Stripe that must implement sophisticated billing scenarios—usage-based, seat-based, or credit-based—UseAutumn.com offers a cost-effective solution: free up to $3 000 MRR, scaling to $375 / month, with no additional Autumn transaction fees (standard Stripe rates still apply). Because Autumn is not a merchant of record, you’ll still need to handle tax compliance separately (e.g., via Stripe Tax).

Traditional low-cost options such as Stripe’s standard plan, Square, PayPal, and Braintree remain compelling for straightforward payment flows, while enterprise-scale organisations may favour Adyen or Digital River for highly customised, global solutions.

Ultimately, assess your transaction volume, compliance obligations, desired billing complexity, and integration effort to choose the platform or combination of tools that best supports your roadmap and growth goals.
