# Comprehensive Comparison of Major Payment Processors for Online Businesses

Selecting the right payment processor is crucial for online businesses, particularly those dealing with digital products or subscriptions, such as SaaS companies. This comparison dives into seven major payment processors—Stripe, Paddle, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Square, and Authorize.Net—focusing on their pricing, features, compliance capabilities (especially for EU businesses), and whether they act as merchants of record (MoR). The analysis aims to help you choose the best processor for your business needs, with a special emphasis on EU compliance as requested.

## What is a Merchant of Record?

A Merchant of Record (MoR) is the entity legally responsible for processing card transactions, handling tax compliance, fraud protection, and customer support related to payments. When a processor acts as MoR, it simplifies compliance for businesses, especially in regions like the EU with complex VAT regulations. Without an MoR, merchants must manage these responsibilities themselves, often requiring additional tools or services.

Stripe’s standard plan and Square offer cost-effective options at 2.9% + $0.30, ideal for startups. PayPal and Braintree provide trusted solutions with broad customer recognition, while Adyen caters to enterprises, and Authorize.Net suits those needing a traditional gateway.
