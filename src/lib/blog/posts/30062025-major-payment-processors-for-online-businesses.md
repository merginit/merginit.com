# Comprehensive Comparison of Major Payment Processors for Online Businesses

Selecting the right payment processor is crucial for online businesses, particularly those dealing with digital products or subscriptions, such as SaaS companies. This comparison dives into ten major payment processors—Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring, Digital River, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Square, and Authorize.Net—focusing on their pricing, features, compliance capabilities (especially for EU businesses), and whether they act as merchants of record (MoR). The analysis aims to help you choose the best processor for your business needs, with a special emphasis on EU compliance and support for digital products.

## What is a Merchant of Record?

A Merchant of Record (MoR) is the entity legally responsible for processing card transactions, handling tax compliance, fraud protection, and customer support related to payments. When a processor acts as MoR, it simplifies compliance for businesses, especially in regions like the EU with complex VAT regulations. Without an MoR, merchants must manage these responsibilities themselves, often requiring additional tools or services.

## Payment Processor Comparisons

It supports both standard payment processing, where the merchant is the MoR, and a newer Managed Payments service, where Stripe acts as the MoR, launched in 2025 following its acquisition of Lemon Squeezy.

**Pricing**:
- **Standard**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (US), varies by country.
- **Managed Payments**: Custom pricing, likely similar to Lemon Squeezy's 5% + $0.50 per transaction.

Paddle and Lemon Squeezy offer straightforward pricing at 5% + $0.50 per transaction, while FastSpring and Digital River provide custom pricing for larger operations. For startups, Stripe's standard plan and Square offer cost-effective solutions at 2.9% + $0.30, while PayPal and Braintree provide trusted options with broad customer recognition. Adyen caters to enterprises, and Authorize.Net suits those needing a traditional gateway. Evaluate your transaction volume, compliance needs, and integration requirements to make an informed decision.
