# The Strange Case of JavaScript's Trademark

<AudioNativePlayer />

## The Fight to Free a Language from its Absentee Owner

When you think of JavaScript, the dynamic, ever-evolving language that powers the modern web, the last company that comes to mind is Oracle. Yet, the tech giant, known for its databases and enterprise software, holds the key to the language's very name. This surprising fact is not just a piece of trivia; it's the basis of a legal battle that pits a passionate open-source community against a corporate behemoth, with the identity of the world's most popular programming language hanging in the balance.

### A History of Convenience and Confusion

The story begins in 1995 at Netscape. A brilliant developer named Brendan Eich was tasked with creating a lightweight scripting language for the Netscape Navigator browser to make web pages more interactive. He famously created the first version, then called "Mocha," in just ten days.

To bolster the new language's appeal, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems, the creators of the hot new programming language, Java. In a marketing move, Mocha was renamed "LiveScript" and then quickly changed to "JavaScript" to ride the coattails of Java's popularity. As part of this agreement, Sun Microsystems held the trademark for the name "JavaScript."

Years later, in 2009, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle. In that multi-billion dollar deal, Oracle inherited all of Sun's assets, including a trademark for a language it had no hand in creating, maintaining, or developing: JavaScript.

### The Problem with an Absentee Landlord

For over a decade, Oracle's ownership has been, as Node.js and Deno creator Ryan Dahl puts it, a "dark cloud looming over the world's most popular programming language." This has created a "chilling effect," forcing developers and organizations to actively avoid using the name to prevent potential legal trouble.

This is why the official, standardized name for the language is "ECMAScript," a name Brendan Eich himself has called an "unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease." It's also why you see "JSConf" instead of a "JavaScript Conference." The community has been forced to use abbreviations and technicalities to avoid provoking a company that has shown little interest in the JavaScript ecosystem beyond holding its name hostage.

### The Community Fights Back

Frustration finally boiled over into action. In 2022, Ryan Dahl published an open letter asking Oracle to release the trademark. After being met with silence, the effort was formalized in 2024 with the launch of the website **javascript.tm**, which contains a strongly-worded letter demanding the release of the trademark. The letter has since gathered over 27,000 signatures from prominent community members, including Brendan Eich himself.

When this too was ignored, Dahl's company, Deno Land Inc., took the next step. In November 2024, they filed a formal petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel the trademark, arguing that:

1.  **"JavaScript" is a generic term:** The name is now universally understood as a generic term for the language, not a specific Oracle product.
2.  **The trademark has been abandoned:** Oracle has not used the trademark for any commercial product, effectively abandoning its claim to it.
3.  **Oracle committed fraud:** The petition alleged that Oracle committed fraud in its 2019 trademark renewal by submitting the Node.js website—a project with which it has no involvement—as evidence of its "use in commerce."

### The Legal Battle and What's Next

Oracle was forced to respond. While ignoring the first two claims, their lawyers filed a partial motion to dismiss the fraud charge. They argued that while they did submit a screenshot of the Node.js site, they _also_ submitted evidence of another project, the "Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)." In June 2025, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) sided with Oracle on this specific point, dismissing the fraud claim by stating the Node.js screenshot wasn't sufficient proof of intent to deceive.

However, the core of the case—the claims of **genericness** and **abandonment**—is moving forward. Oracle filed its answer to the petition on August 6, 2025, denying the remaining claims. As of August 28, 2025, the case is pending, with discovery set to begin on September 6, 2025. Here is the expected timeline for the case, based on typical TTAB proceedings (which often last 1-2 years or more):

- **September 2025 - Mid-2026:** Both sides are in the "discovery" phase, where they gather evidence and set the ground rules for the trial. This typically lasts about 180 days.
- **Summer 2026:** Deno and Oracle will present their main arguments and evidence to the board during the trial period.
- **End of 2026:** Closing arguments and briefs will be submitted.
- **Early 2027:** A final decision from the USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is expected, though delays are common in such cases.

### The Stakes for the Web

If Deno wins, the name "JavaScript" will be officially released into the public domain, free for everyone to use. It would be a landmark victory for the open-source community, removing the legal ambiguity that has shadowed the language for years. If Oracle wins, the status quo remains, and the community will continue to navigate the awkward reality of a language whose name is owned by a silent, detached corporation.

Regardless of the outcome, this case highlights a fundamental clash in the tech world: the spirit of open, collaborative development versus the rigid confines of corporate ownership and intellectual property law. For the millions of developers who build their careers with JavaScript, the decision in 2027 can't come soon enough.
