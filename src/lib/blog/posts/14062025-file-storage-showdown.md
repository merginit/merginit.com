# File Storage Options: Mega, Storj, and Open-Source Compared

In today's digital world, selecting the right file storage solution is essential, whether you're an individual safeguarding personal files or a developer managing application data. This article evaluates two standout services: [Mega](https://mega.io/pricing) for consumer cloud storage and [Storj](https://www.storj.io/pricing) for application object storage. We compare them against all well-positioned competitors, analyze speed, security, and price, and explore open-source alternatives for both categories to determine the best options. Mega's advanced file filtering, which allows precise control over synchronization, is a key highlight for consumers, setting it apart from services like Google Drive.

## Consumer Cloud Storage

### Mega: Secure and Feature-Rich

Mega, a New Zealand-based provider, is renowned for its privacy-first approach. It offers end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the user can access their data, making it ideal for privacy-conscious individuals. Mega provides a 20GB free tier, expandable to 30GB for the first year through tasks like app installation. Paid plans start at ~$6.09/month for 400GB, with the 2TB Pro I plan at ~$10.59/month (€9.99/month, converted at 1.06 USD/EUR).

**Advanced File Filtering**

Mega's unique file filtering feature allows users to use wildcards for sync exclusions, such as excluding files with specific extensions (e.g., \*.bak) or patterns. This granular control optimizes bandwidth and storage, a capability not as robustly offered by competitors like Google Drive, which relies on basic folder selection.
