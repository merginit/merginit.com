# Privacy-First AI: The Rise of Confidential Chatbots

<AudioNativePlayer />

## The New Wave of AI: Privacy-First Chatbots Enter the Scene

In the ever-expanding universe of artificial intelligence, a new contender has emerged, promising to keep your conversations confidential. Proton, the company renowned for its encrypted email and VPN services, has introduced Lumo, a privacy-first AI assistant. This move signals a growing demand for AI tools that don't just offer intelligence, but also prioritize user privacy.

### Lumo: Confidential Conversations in the Age of AI

Lumo distinguishes itself from mainstream AI chatbots like ChatGPT by putting privacy at its core. It employs zero-access encryption, meaning that your conversations are stored locally on your device and are inaccessible to anyone else, including Proton itself. The company asserts that it keeps no logs of your chats and that your data will never be used to train their models.

For those who want to use the web search feature, it must be enabled manually. Even then, Lumo utilizes privacy-friendly search engines. Other features include a "Ghost mode" that deletes your conversation after you close it, the ability to upload and analyze files without the data being stored, and integration with Proton Drive for seamless and secure file sharing.

Lumo is accessible via its website and mobile apps for both Android and iOS. A free version is available to everyone, even without a Proton account, with certain usage limits. For more extensive use, Lumo Plus is available for a monthly fee.

### The Broader Landscape of Privacy-Focused AI

Lumo is not alone in the burgeoning field of private AI. Here's a look at some of the other players:

* **DuckDuckGo AI:** Known for its privacy-centric search engine, DuckDuckGo has extended its philosophy to an AI chat feature. Duck.ai allows users to interact with various AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, all while keeping the conversations anonymous and untracked. It's a free service that doesn't require an account, making it a highly accessible option.

* **Kagi:** This paid search engine offers an ad-free and private experience. Its "Assistant" feature provides access to a range of large language models for both chatting and web searching. Kagi's business model is user-funded, which allows it to focus on user experience and privacy rather than advertising and data collection.

### The Spectrum of AI Privacy

The approaches to AI privacy vary widely. On one end of the spectrum are the mainstream AI models like ChatGPT, which often use your data to train their systems. While paid versions of these services may offer better privacy policies, the free versions generally provide the least privacy.

In the middle ground are services like DuckDuckGo AI and Kagi, which act as proxies, anonymizing your requests before sending them to other AI models. This provides a good balance of privacy and functionality.

At the most private end of the spectrum are tools like Lumo and local, open-source AI models. These options give users the most control over their data by keeping it encrypted and stored locally.

The introduction of Lumo and the growing popularity of other privacy-focused AI tools indicate a clear trend: users are increasingly demanding AI that respects their privacy. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the choice of which tool to use will likely depend not just on its intelligence, but on its commitment to keeping our data safe.
