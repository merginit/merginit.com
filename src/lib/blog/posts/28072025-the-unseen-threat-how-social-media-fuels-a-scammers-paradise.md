# The Rise of Online Fraud

<AudioNativePlayer />

## The Unseen Threat: How Social Media Fuels a Scammer's Paradise

> **The internet has long been a double-edged sword. While it connects us in ways never before possible, it has also opened the door to a dark and burgeoning criminal economy. A recent surge in online fraud, particularly on social media platforms, has left consumers and financial institutions scrambling to keep up. The data is stark, and the message is clear: we are in the midst of a digital crime wave, and your social media feed is the new frontline.**

A staggering amount of fraud originates from platforms owned by Meta, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. According to a report from the global fintech company Revolut, over half of all reported scams in the latter half of 2024 originated on Meta's platforms. This isn't a new problem, but it is a rapidly growing one. The rise of cryptocurrencies, generative AI, and sophisticated overseas crime networks has created a perfect storm for scammers.

The consequences are significant. JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., reported that nearly half of all Zelle scams in a one-year period originated on Meta's platforms. This trend is not limited to the United States; regulators in the United Kingdom and Australia have reported similar findings.

Financial institutions are finding themselves in a constant battle against these fraudsters. While banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, they are often playing catch-up. The sheer volume of transactions, especially with the advent of near-instant payments, makes it difficult for traditional fraud detection methods to be effective.

Some in the banking industry are calling for greater collaboration and information sharing to combat this threat. Federated learning, a type of AI that allows banks to share intelligence on bad actors without compromising customer privacy, is one promising avenue being explored. However, there is a growing consensus that social media companies need to take more responsibility for the criminal activity flourishing on their platforms. Revolut, for its part, has been vocal in its call for social media giants to proactively remove scam content, verify advertisers, and share in the financial reimbursement of scam victims.

For consumers, the message is one of heightened vigilance. Purchase scams remain the most common type of fraud, with ticket scams targeting younger demographics becoming increasingly prevalent. The ease with which scammers can operate on social media, combined with the trust users place in these platforms, creates a dangerous combination.

### What Can You Do?

While the ultimate solution requires a concerted effort from tech companies, financial institutions, and regulators, there are steps you can take to protect yourself:

* **Be skeptical of unsolicited messages and offers.** If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* **Verify the identity of anyone you are sending money to.** Be especially wary of requests for payment through peer-to-peer apps from people you don't know.
* **Secure your accounts.** Use strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
* **Stay informed.** Keep up to date on the latest scams and tactics being used by fraudsters.

The fight against online fraud is a complex and ongoing challenge. By understanding the scale of the problem and taking steps to protect ourselves, we can all play a part in making the digital world a safer place.
