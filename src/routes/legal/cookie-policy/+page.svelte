								Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use

								called"tracking pixels"or"clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
								unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
								Websiteor opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor

								<span>

										deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
										website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to
										improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
										campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
										function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
